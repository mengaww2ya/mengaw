    <div class="observation"> <p> Thanks for you pationt here is my opinion <br>i think every person is good,means every one has potentialto to be
        good when he was born. <br>
        you may ask why today poeple have been crude, bad? yes you this quesion is necessary
        ,but even if human being have apotential to be good environment is one of the biggest and main factor to change
        human behavior. <br>
        this means person to be good there is environmental factor like palce the he born,game he play,friend that he
        ply with,family ,poeple around him,
        regulations that ruled him,government, religious that he follow </p>
    <p>let me take child, start from his born he register every thing that he see and hear from his family
        ,nighbour,from other poeple around him
        <br>not only he register from persons around him but also from every thing around him, even pets ,small
        insects,birds plants.
        but mostly register from human.
    </p>
     <p>after he see or hear things he he want to exercise as he see or hear.he continue by
        register and exercise every thing that he see and hear. after 7 or above years old he will register and exercise
        from poeple he love more and
        who close to him, they may family. <br>this means person's behavior is the result of learning from family,
        environment,even animals
        ,birds,insects.this result may change if the above learning environment is change,

         <p>have you get my idea?,<br>what is the actor in the worled ?<br>
        i think the main actor in the worled is human.
        suppose if every one grew and exercise that of above tips ,
        every thing that we see on the worled would be good. 
        but every one born and grow in different ,family
        ,environment ,
        becouse of this every one have different behavior.
         </p>
 <p> <h1>for every one</h1>
     when you have achild be good environment to teach him.if all of you do this after 15 or 20
    yoars latter
    the worled will be change completely.this means if you are good today 15 years latter worled be as good as every one
    want.like
    no war,but pease do you want the smooth and good worled? 
  </p>
